# Document Templates

This directory contains reusable templates for common document types used in the project.

## Available Templates

Templates will be added here as the project grows. Examples of templates that may be useful:

- Project proposals
- Meeting notes
- Technical specifications
- User stories
- Test plans
- Retrospective summaries

## Using Templates

1. Copy the template file you need
2. Rename it appropriately for your use case
3. Fill in the template sections with your specific content
4. Remove any sections that don't apply to your situation

## Creating New Templates

When creating a new template:

- Use clear section headings
- Include brief instructions or examples in each section
- Make it easy to understand what information goes where
- Keep it generic enough to be reusable
