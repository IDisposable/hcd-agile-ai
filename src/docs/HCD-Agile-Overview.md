# HCD Agile: Overview

## What is HCD Agile?

HCD Agile is a methodology that combines **Human-Centered Design (HCD)** principles with **Agile development** practices. This approach ensures that software products are not only built efficiently and iteratively but also meet the real needs of users through continuous research, testing, and validation.

## Why HCD Agile?

Traditional Agile development focuses on rapid iteration and continuous delivery, but sometimes lacks deep user research and validation. Pure Human-Centered Design provides excellent user insights but can be slow and waterfall-like in execution. HCD Agile bridges this gap by:

- **Putting users at the center** of every sprint and decision
- **Iterating quickly** with working software while gathering user feedback
- **Reducing risk** by validating assumptions early and often
- **Building empathy** within the development team for end users
- **Delivering value** that users actually need, not just what was specified

## Core Principles

1. **Empathy First**: Understand users deeply through research and observation
2. **Iterative Learning**: Each sprint includes learning cycles about user needs
3. **Collaborative Design**: Cross-functional teams work together throughout
4. **Continuous Validation**: Test with real users frequently
5. **Flexible Planning**: Adapt based on user feedback and research insights
6. **Rapid Prototyping**: Create quick prototypes to test concepts before building
7. **Measurable Outcomes**: Define success through user-centric metrics

## The HCD Agile Difference

| Traditional Agile  | HCD Agile   |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Focus on delivering features | Focus on solving user problems |
| User stories from requirements | User stories from research |
| Occasional user testing | Continuous user validation |
| Dev team decides UX | Users guide UX decisions |
| Sprint output is code | Sprint output includes learnings |

## Key Components

- **Discovery Sprints**: Dedicated time for user research and problem exploration
- **Design Sprints**: Rapid ideation and prototyping sessions
- **Development Sprints**: Building validated solutions incrementally
- **Validation Sessions**: Regular user testing and feedback loops
- **Retrospectives**: Including user insights in team reflection

## Benefits

- Higher user satisfaction and adoption rates
- Reduced waste from building unwanted features
- Better team alignment around user needs
- Faster identification of wrong assumptions
- More innovative solutions through user collaboration
- Improved product-market fit

## Getting Started

To implement HCD Agile in your organization:

1. Form cross-functional teams (designers, developers, researchers)
2. Establish regular user research practices
3. Integrate user testing into every sprint
4. Create a culture of empathy and user-focused thinking
5. Use appropriate tools for research, prototyping, and testing
6. Measure success through user outcomes, not just features shipped
