# HCD Agile Bootstrap Templates

This directory contains reusable Markdown templates for implementing Human-Centered Design (HCD) with an Agile approach in collaboration with AI agents.

- **Discovery-Template.md**: Gather insights and form a shared vision
- **Delivery-Template.md**: Iterate on building and validation
- **Transition-Template.md**: Handle handoff and closure
- **Init-HCD-Agile.md**: Master bootstrap file to orchestrate all phases
  
## Overview

The meta-framework revolves around three pillars:
1. **Preparation**: Setup templates (these files)
2. **Instantiation**: Applying to a specific case
3. **Iteration**: Feedback and refinement

## Templates

### 1. Discovery-Template.md
Focuses on gathering insights to form a shared vision. Includes:
- Business/User Goals
- User Needs and Context with Empathy Mapping
- Tech/Feasibility Insights
- Shared Vision Statement

### 2. Delivery-Template.md
For iterative building and validation. Includes:
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Plan
- Validation Loops
- Adaptations based on feedback

### 3. Transition-Template.md
For handoff and closure. Includes:
- Final Outputs
- Knowledge Transfer
- Handoff Checklist
- Next Steps

### 4. Init-HCD-Agile.md
Master bootstrap file that ties all phases together and provides guidance for AI interaction.

## How to Use

### Instantiation Process

1. **Duplicate templates**: Copy the relevant template(s) for your project
2. **Fill in specifics**: Replace placeholder text (in brackets) with your project details
3. **Compile**: Use Init-HCD-Agile.md to reference or combine all phases
4. **Prompt AI**: Share the filled template with your AI agent to bootstrap the interaction

### Example Workflow

For a project like "Designing a sustainable urban transport app":

1. Duplicate `Discovery-Template.md`
2. Fill in user pain points (e.g., traffic frustration, eco-concerns)
3. Add to `Init-HCD-Agile.md`
4. Prompt: "Follow this HCD Agile bootstrap for designing a sustainable urban transport app: [Paste filled Markdown]. Guide us through Discovery first."

### Adaptability

- **Short projects**: Condense templates by removing optional sections
- **Complex projects**: Add sub-sections like risk matrices or detailed sprint breakdowns
- **Multiple projects**: Build a library of filled templates as case studies

## Iteration and Improvement

Treat the meta-framework itself as an HCD Agile project:

1. After each instance, use the Transition phase to note what worked
2. Update templates based on learnings
3. Periodically prompt AI: "Review this completed instance's outputs against HCD Agile principles. Suggest meta-framework improvements."

## Key Benefits

- **Structured yet flexible**: Markdown format with headers, bullets, tables, and code blocks
- **Version control**: Track changes to templates over time
- **Reusability**: Build on past work and patterns
- **AI-friendly**: Clear structure helps AI agents understand and follow the process
- **Context management**: Markdown structure helps summarize prior context across sessions

## Tips

- Use tables for prioritization and empathy mapping
- Include recaps in prompts to maintain context across AI sessions
- Ensure templates prompt for human input at validation points
- Start broad, then dive deeper as needed
- Include depth levels (basic vs. advanced) for scalability
