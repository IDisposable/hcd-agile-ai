# HCD Agile Discovery Phase for [Project Name]

## Business/User Goals

- Primary objective: [e.g., Streamline meal planning for busy parents]
- Key stakeholders: [List users, e.g., parents, kids, app devs]
- Constraints: [e.g., Budget, time, tech limits]

## User Needs and Context

- Observations: [Real-world pain points, e.g., "Parents juggle work and picky eaters; observed via surveys or stories"]
- Empathy Map:
  
  | What Users Think | What Users Feel | What Users Say | What Users Do |
  |------------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
  | [e.g., "Too many apps"] | [e.g., Frustrated] | [e.g., "I need quick ideas"] | [e.g., Skip meals]

## Tech/Feasibility Insights

- Available tools/data: [e.g., AI agent's code execution for simulations]
- Risks: [e.g., AI hallucinations on user emotions]

## Shared Vision Statement

[Concise summary: "Build an empathetic meal planner that adapts to family dynamics."]
