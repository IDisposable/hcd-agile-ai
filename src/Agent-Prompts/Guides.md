# AI Platform Guides for Human-Centered Design with Agile

## 🎯 Important: These Are Meta-Prompt Templates

**The files in this directory are NOT conversation starters.** They are **meta-prompt templates** designed to be pasted into your AI agent as custom instructions or system prompts **before you start** your HCD-Agile work.

### How to Use

1. **Choose your platform** (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, or Grok)
2. **Load the template** into your AI agent's custom instructions or at the start of your session
3. **Begin your actual work** - the AI will now provide HCD-Agile guidance

See **[ReadMe.md](./)** for detailed usage instructions.

## The HCD-Agile Process

All guides follow the same five-phase HCD process adapted for Agile sprints:

### 1. 🔍 Discovery

**Goal:** Understand users and their needs

**Activities:**

- User research planning
- Interviews and surveys
- Observational studies
- Data collection and analysis

**Sprint integration:** Often spans multiple sprints; can be done incrementally

---

### 2. 📋 Define

**Goal:** Synthesize insights and define the problem

**Activities:**

- Research synthesis
- Affinity mapping
- User needs identification
- Problem statement creation
- "How Might We" questions

**Sprint integration:** Typically fits within one sprint; outputs inform backlog prioritization

---

### 3. 💡 Ideate

**Goal:** Generate diverse solution ideas

**Activities:**

- Brainstorming sessions
- Idea generation
- Concept exploration
- Solution prioritization

**Sprint integration:** Can be done in workshops within a sprint; generates backlog items

---

### 4. 🛠️ Prototype

**Goal:** Create testable representations of solutions

**Activities:**

- Rapid prototyping
- MVP definition
- Low-to-high fidelity prototypes
- Technical feasibility assessment

**Sprint integration:** Builds on sprint deliverables; outputs are sprint demos

---

### 5. ✅ Test

**Goal:** Validate solutions with users

**Activities:**

- User testing
- Feedback collection
- Iteration planning
- Success measurement

**Sprint integration:** Testing occurs at end of sprint; feedback informs next sprint

---

## General Best Practices

Regardless of which AI platform you use:

### 1. Always Ground AI in User Research

- AI should assist, not replace, talking to real users
- Validate AI suggestions with user feedback
- Use AI to analyze and synthesize, not to assume user needs

### 2. Provide Rich Context

- Share user research findings with your AI assistant
- Explain project constraints and goals
- Reference user personas and problem statements

### 3. Iterate on AI Prompts

- First responses may be generic; refine with follow-up questions
- Be specific about format, depth, and perspective you need
- Build on previous responses in conversation

### 4. Balance Speed and Depth

- Use AI for rapid exploration, but don't skip critical thinking
- Agile values speed, but HCD requires some depth
- Time-box AI-assisted activities to stay within sprint constraints

### 5. Combine AI Strengths

- Use conversational AI for research and strategy
- Use code-focused AI for implementation
- Different tools for different phases and activities

### 6. Maintain the Human Element

- AI enhances human creativity and empathy, doesn't replace it
- Critical HCD activities (user interviews, testing) need human facilitation
- Use judgment in evaluating AI suggestions

### 7. Document Everything

- Keep track of research insights
- Document design decisions and rationale
- Maintain a clear audit trail for stakeholders

## Sprint Integration Tips

### Sprint Planning

- Include HCD activities as stories in your sprint
- Estimate HCD work like any other story (story points or time)
- Balance research/design with development work

### Daily Standups

- Report on HCD activities alongside development progress
- Share user insights that might affect sprint direction
- Identify when user feedback is needed

### Sprint Reviews

- Show prototypes and gather stakeholder feedback
- Present user research findings
- Demonstrate how work addresses user needs

### Retrospectives

- Reflect on how well you understood and served users
- Evaluate effectiveness of HCD practices
- Improve the integration of HCD and Agile

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your platform:** Select the guide that matches your team's AI tools
2. **Identify your HCD phase:** Determine where you are in the process
3. **Review relevant prompts:** Find templates for your current activities
4. **Adapt to your context:** Customize prompts with your project details
5. **Iterate and refine:** Improve prompts based on results
