# Agent.MD: Discovery Phase

## Phase Overview

**Phase**: Discovery (Phase 1 of 5)

**Purpose**: Research and understand the problem space, users, and context before defining solutions.

**Duration**: Typically 1-3 sprints

**Mindset**: "Learn and explore" - Focus on understanding, not solving

## HCDAgile Discovery Principles

In the Discovery phase, we prioritize:

1. **Deep Empathy**: Understand users' needs, motivations, and pain points
2. **Open-Minded Exploration**: Avoid jumping to solutions
3. **Diverse Perspectives**: Gather insights from multiple stakeholders
4. **Context Understanding**: Learn about the environment where solutions will be used
5. **Evidence-Based Insights**: Ground understanding in real data and observations

## Primary Goals

- [ ] Identify and understand target users
- [ ] Map the current state and user journey
- [ ] Discover pain points and unmet needs
- [ ] Understand context and constraints
- [ ] Build empathy with users
- [ ] Gather qualitative and quantitative data
- [ ] Identify stakeholders and their interests

## Key Activities

### User Research

- Conduct user interviews (5-15 users minimum)
- Perform observational studies
- Review existing user data and analytics
- Create or update user personas
- Map user journeys and touchpoints

### Stakeholder Engagement

- Interview key stakeholders
- Understand business objectives
- Identify constraints and requirements
- Map stakeholder landscape

### Context Research

- Analyze competitive landscape
- Review industry best practices
- Understand technical constraints
- Assess organizational capabilities

### Data Analysis

- Review existing metrics and data
- Identify gaps in understanding
- Synthesize research findings
- Document insights and patterns

## Deliverables

1. **Research Plan**: Outline of research activities and timeline
2. **User Personas**: 2-4 representative user archetypes
3. **Journey Maps**: Current state user journeys
4. **Research Synthesis**: Key findings and insights document
5. **Opportunity Areas**: Identified areas for potential solutions
6. **Stakeholder Map**: Visual representation of stakeholder landscape

## AI Agent Instructions

### Your Role in Discovery

As an AI agent in the Discovery phase, your role is to:

- Help analyze and synthesize research data
- Identify patterns and themes in user feedback
- Draft user personas and journey maps
- Organize and structure research findings
- Suggest questions for user research
- Assist with competitive analysis

### Research Questions to Explore

- Who are the users and what are their goals?
- What problems are they trying to solve?
- What is their current process/workflow?
- What pain points do they experience?
- What workarounds have they created?
- What would success look like for them?
- What constraints do they operate within?

### Working Approach

- **Be Curious**: Ask follow-up questions to deepen understanding
- **Suspend Judgment**: Avoid evaluating or proposing solutions yet
- **Seek Patterns**: Look for themes across multiple users/sources
- **Stay Grounded**: Base insights on evidence, not assumptions
- **Embrace Ambiguity**: It's okay not to have all answers yet

### Prohibited Actions

- ❌ Do not propose solutions or designs in this phase
- ❌ Do not make assumptions about user needs without data
- ❌ Do not skip research to "save time"
- ❌ Do not focus only on technical feasibility
- ❌ Do not ignore outlier users or edge cases

## Success Criteria

The Discovery phase is complete when:

- ✅ You have talked to at least 5-15 representative users
- ✅ Clear patterns and themes have emerged from research
- ✅ User personas are validated with real user data
- ✅ Key pain points are well understood
- ✅ Opportunity areas are clearly articulated
- ✅ Stakeholders are aligned on findings
- ✅ The team has deep empathy for users

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Solution Jumping**: Proposing solutions before understanding the problem
2. **Confirmation Bias**: Only seeking data that confirms assumptions
3. **Narrow Focus**: Talking to only one user type or stakeholder
4. **Surface-Level Insights**: Not digging deep enough into "why"
5. **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-researching without synthesis
6. **Ignoring Context**: Not understanding environmental factors

## Transition to Define Phase

You're ready to move to the Define phase when:

- Research insights are synthesized and validated
- Team has shared understanding of user needs
- Opportunity areas are clearly identified
- Stakeholders are aligned on findings
- You have enough data to define the problem statement

## Tools & Templates

### Research Templates

- User interview guide
- Observation notes template
- Persona template
- Journey map template
- Research synthesis framework

### Analysis Tools

- Affinity mapping for theme identification
- Empathy mapping for user understanding
- Stakeholder mapping for relationship visualization
- Competitive analysis matrix

## Example Research Questions

**About Users**:

- What does a typical day look like for you?
- Walk me through how you currently `[perform task]`
- What's frustrating about the current approach?
- What have you tried to improve the situation?

**About Context**:

- What tools/systems do you currently use?
- Who else is involved in this process?
- What constraints do you work within?
- What would ideal look like?

**About Impact**:

- How much time does this take currently?
- What's at stake if this doesn't work well?
- Who benefits from solving this problem?
- What would change if this were better?

**Remember**: The goal of Discovery is not to have all the answers, rather to ask the right questions and deeply understand the problem space before moving to solutions.
