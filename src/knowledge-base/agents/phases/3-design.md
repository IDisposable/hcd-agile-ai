# Agent.MD: Design Phase

## Phase Overview

**Phase**: Design (Phase 3 of 5)

**Purpose**: Ideate, prototype, and test potential solutions to the defined problems.

**Duration**: Typically 2-4 sprints (iterative cycles)

**Mindset**: "Diverge then converge" - Explore many ideas, then narrow to the best

## HCDAgile Design Principles

In the Design phase, we prioritize:

1. **Quantity First, Quality Second**: Generate many ideas before judging
2. **Prototype to Learn**: Build to test, not to perfect
3. **Fail Fast, Learn Faster**: Embrace quick failures as learning
4. **User Validation**: Test early and often with real users
5. **Iterate Relentlessly**: Refine based on feedback

## Primary Goals

- [ ] Generate diverse solution concepts
- [ ] Create low-fidelity prototypes
- [ ] Test concepts with users
- [ ] Iterate based on feedback
- [ ] Converge on validated solution direction
- [ ] Create high-fidelity prototypes
- [ ] Validate design with stakeholders

## Key Activities

### Ideation

- Conduct brainstorming sessions
- Use "How Might We" questions as prompts
- Generate 50+ ideas per HMW question
- Avoid judgment during ideation
- Build on others' ideas
- Document all concepts

### Concept Development

- Group similar ideas
- Develop promising concepts
- Create concept sketches
- Define user flows
- Map interaction patterns

### Prototyping

- Build low-fidelity prototypes (paper, wireframes)
- Create clickable prototypes
- Develop interactive mockups
- Build testable experiences
- Iterate rapidly

### User Testing

- Test prototypes with 5-8 users per iteration
- Observe user behavior
- Gather feedback
- Identify friction points
- Validate assumptions
- Document findings

### Iteration

- Analyze test results
- Identify patterns in feedback
- Refine designs
- Retest with users
- Repeat until validated

## Deliverables

1. **Concept Sketches**: 20-50 rough solution ideas
2. **Low-Fidelity Prototypes**: Paper or basic digital mockups
3. **User Flow Diagrams**: Visual representation of user paths
4. **High-Fidelity Prototypes**: Interactive, realistic mockups
5. **Usability Test Reports**: Findings from user testing sessions
6. **Design Specifications**: Detailed design documentation
7. **Pattern Library**: Reusable design components

## AI Agent Instructions

### Your Role in Design

As an AI agent in the Design phase, your role is to:

- Generate diverse solution concepts
- Create user flow diagrams and wireframes
- Draft design specifications
- Suggest interaction patterns
- Identify accessibility considerations
- Document design decisions
- Assist with usability test planning
- Synthesize user feedback

### Ideation Guidelines

- **Go for quantity**: Generate many ideas before evaluating
- **Defer judgment**: Don't critique during brainstorming
- **Build on ideas**: "Yes, and..." not "No, but..."
- **Think diverse**: Explore different approaches
- **Visualize**: Sketch ideas, even roughly
- **Stay on topic**: Use HMW questions to focus

### Prototyping Principles

- **Start low-fidelity**: Paper, sketches, wireframes first
- **Build just enough**: Prototype what you need to test
- **Iterate quickly**: Create, test, refine, repeat
- **Make it testable**: Ensure users can interact with it
- **Don't get attached**: Be ready to throw away and restart

### Design Fidelity Progression

1. **Sketches**: Rough ideas on paper (minutes to create)
2. **Wireframes**: Basic layout and structure (hours to create)
3. **Mockups**: Visual design applied (day to create)
4. **Prototypes**: Interactive, clickable (days to create)
5. **Specifications**: Detailed implementation guide

### Working Approach

- **Diverge First**: Generate many options before narrowing
- **Test Assumptions**: Validate through user testing
- **Follow Patterns**: Use established UX patterns when appropriate
- **Design Accessible**: Consider all users from the start
- **Document Decisions**: Explain the "why" behind choices

### Prohibited Actions

- ❌ Do not skip user testing
- ❌ Do not fall in love with first idea
- ❌ Do not design in isolation without feedback
- ❌ Do not ignore accessibility requirements
- ❌ Do not build high-fidelity before validating concept
- ❌ Do not assume you know what users want

## Success Criteria

The Design phase is complete when:

- ✅ Multiple concepts have been explored
- ✅ Users have tested prototypes (5+ users, 2+ iterations)
- ✅ Major usability issues are identified and addressed
- ✅ Design validates against success metrics
- ✅ Accessibility requirements are incorporated
- ✅ Stakeholders approve design direction
- ✅ Design is ready for development

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **First Idea Bias**: Falling in love with the first solution
2. **Skipping Lo-Fi**: Starting with high-fidelity designs
3. **Design in Vacuum**: Not testing with users
4. **Over-Designing**: Perfecting before validating
5. **Ignoring Feedback**: Defending design instead of learning
6. **Feature Creep**: Adding features not validated by users
7. **Accessibility Afterthought**: Not considering from the start

## Usability Testing Guide

### Test Preparation

- Define test objectives
- Create test scenarios/tasks
- Recruit representative users (5-8 per round)
- Prepare testing environment
- Create observation guide

### During Testing

- Have users think aloud
- Observe, don't lead
- Ask follow-up questions
- Note friction points
- Watch body language
- Record sessions (with permission)

### After Testing

- Synthesize findings
- Identify patterns
- Prioritize issues
- Create action plan
- Share with team

### Key Questions to Ask

- "What are you trying to do here?"
- "What do you expect to happen?"
- "Is this what you expected?"
- "What's confusing about this?"
- "How would you improve this?"

## Design Best Practices

### Interaction Design

- Use familiar patterns
- Provide clear affordances
- Give immediate feedback
- Make actions reversible
- Show system status

### Visual Design

- Maintain visual hierarchy
- Use consistent styling
- Ensure sufficient contrast
- Align with brand guidelines
- Design for all screen sizes

### Content Design

- Use clear, concise language
- Write in active voice
- Avoid jargon
- Provide helpful error messages
- Guide user through flows

### Accessibility

- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Provide text alternatives
- Use semantic HTML
- Test with screen readers
- Design for color blindness

## Transition to Develop Phase

You're ready to move to the Develop phase when:

- Design has been validated through user testing
- Major usability issues are resolved
- Stakeholders approve the design
- Specifications are complete
- Development team understands requirements
- Accessibility requirements are defined
- Success metrics can be tracked

## Iteration Checklist

After each round of user testing:

- [ ] Synthesize user feedback
- [ ] Identify top 3-5 issues to address
- [ ] Prioritize based on impact
- [ ] Refine design to address issues
- [ ] Validate changes don't create new problems
- [ ] Plan next testing round

**Remember**: Design is not about creating something pretty; it's about creating something that works for users. Test early, test often, and be willing to throw away ideas that don't work.
