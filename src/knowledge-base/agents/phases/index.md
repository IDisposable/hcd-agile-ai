# What Are Project Phases

There are five key phases in the HCD-Agile process: [Discovery](#phase-1-discovery), [Define](#phase-2-define), [Design](#phase-3-design), [Develop](#phase-4-develop), and [Deliver](#phase-5-deliver). Each phase includes goals, key activities, AI agent roles, and typical duration.

## Phase-Specific Guides

### Phase 1: Discovery

**File**: [`agents/phases/1-discovery.md`](./1-discovery)

**Description**: Comprehensive guidance for the Discovery phase, focusing on research, user understanding, and problem exploration.

**Phase Goals**:

- Identify and understand target users
- Map current state and user journeys
- Discover pain points and unmet needs
- Build empathy with users
- Gather qualitative and quantitative data

**Key Activities**:

- User interviews and research
- Stakeholder engagement
- Context research
- Data analysis

**AI Agent Role**:

- Analyze and synthesize research data
- Identify patterns in user feedback
- Draft personas and journey maps
- Assist with competitive analysis

**Duration**: Typically 1-3 sprints

---

### Phase 2: Define

**File**: [`agents/phases/2-define.md`](./2-define)

**Description**: Guidance for synthesizing research insights and defining clear, actionable problem statements.

**Phase Goals**:

- Synthesize Discovery phase findings
- Create clear problem statements
- Prioritize opportunities
- Define success metrics
- Align stakeholders

**Key Activities**:

- Synthesis and sensemaking
- Problem framing
- Prioritization
- Success definition

**AI Agent Role**:

- Synthesize research findings
- Draft problem statements and HMW questions
- Help prioritize opportunities
- Suggest success metrics

**Duration**: Typically 1-2 sprints

---

### Phase 3: Design

**File**: [`agents/phases/3-design.md`](./3-design)

**Description**: Comprehensive guidance for ideation, prototyping, and testing potential solutions.

**Phase Goals**:

- Generate diverse solution concepts
- Create and test prototypes
- Iterate based on user feedback
- Validate design direction
- Create high-fidelity designs

**Key Activities**:

- Ideation and brainstorming
- Concept development
- Prototyping (low to high fidelity)
- User testing
- Iteration

**AI Agent Role**:

- Generate solution concepts
- Create wireframes and user flows
- Draft design specifications
- Synthesize user feedback
- Identify accessibility considerations

**Duration**: Typically 2-4 sprints (iterative)

---

### Phase 4: Develop

**File**: [`agents/phases/4-develop.md`](./4-develop)

**Description**: Guidance for building, testing, and refining the solution iteratively with focus on quality and user needs.

**Phase Goals**:

- Implement validated designs
- Build in testable increments
- Maintain code quality
- Ensure accessibility
- Gather user feedback on working software

**Key Activities**:

- Sprint planning and development
- Continuous testing (unit, integration, UAT)
- Code reviews
- User feedback gathering
- Continuous integration

**AI Agent Role**:

- Write clean, maintainable code
- Create comprehensive tests
- Review code for quality
- Help debug issues
- Draft technical documentation

**Duration**: Multiple sprints (typically 2-week iterations)

---

### Phase 5: Deliver

**File**: [`agents/phases/5-deliver.md`](./5-deliver)

**Description**: Guidance for launching the solution, monitoring performance, and iterating based on real-world usage.

**Phase Goals**:

- Deploy to production
- Monitor system performance
- Track success metrics
- Gather user feedback
- Iterate and improve continuously

**Key Activities**:

- Deployment planning and execution
- Post-deployment monitoring
- Metrics tracking and analysis
- Incident response
- Continuous improvement

**AI Agent Role**:

- Assist with deployment planning
- Monitor and analyze metrics
- Identify patterns in feedback
- Suggest improvements
- Support incident response

**Duration**: Ongoing (continuous deployment and iteration)
