# Agent.MD: Define Phase

## Phase Overview

**Phase**: Define (Phase 2 of 5)

**Purpose**: Synthesize research insights and define clear problem statements that will guide solution development.

**Duration**: Typically 1-2 sprints

**Mindset**: "Focus and frame" - Synthesize insights into actionable problem statements

## HCDAgile Define Principles

In the Define phase, we prioritize:

1. **Synthesis Over Collection**: Turn data into insights
2. **Clarity Over Complexity**: Create clear, focused problem statements
3. **User-Centered Framing**: Frame problems from user perspective
4. **Actionable Outcomes**: Define problems that suggest solution directions
5. **Shared Understanding**: Align team and stakeholders on what to solve

## Primary Goals

- [ ] Synthesize Discovery phase research findings
- [ ] Create clear problem statements
- [ ] Prioritize opportunities to address
- [ ] Define success metrics
- [ ] Align stakeholders on problem definition
- [ ] Create "How Might We" questions
- [ ] Establish design principles

## Key Activities

### Synthesis & Sensemaking

- Review all Discovery phase research
- Identify patterns and themes
- Create affinity diagrams
- Distill key insights
- Validate findings with stakeholders

### Problem Framing

- Write problem statements
- Create "How Might We" (HMW) questions
- Frame challenges as opportunities
- Define problem scope and boundaries
- Validate problem statements with users

### Prioritization

- Evaluate opportunity areas
- Assess impact vs. effort
- Align with business objectives
- Get stakeholder buy-in
- Create prioritized roadmap

### Success Definition

- Define success metrics
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Establish baseline measurements
- Set goals and targets
- Create measurement plan

## Deliverables

1. **Problem Statement(s)**: Clear, user-centered problem definitions
2. **How Might We Questions**: 5-10 reframed challenges as opportunities
3. **Design Principles**: 3-5 guiding principles for solution development
4. **Success Metrics**: Defined KPIs and measurement plan
5. **Prioritized Opportunities**: Ranked list of areas to address
6. **Project Brief**: Summary document for stakeholder alignment

## AI Agent Instructions

### Your Role in Define

As an AI agent in the Define phase, your role is to:

- Synthesize research findings into clear insights
- Draft problem statements and HMW questions
- Help prioritize opportunities
- Suggest success metrics and KPIs
- Create structured synthesis documents
- Facilitate pattern identification
- Validate problem framing

### Problem Statement Framework

A good problem statement should:

- Be user-centered (focus on user needs, not solutions)
- Be specific yet broad enough to allow creative solutions
- Be based on research evidence
- Avoid embedding solutions
- Inspire action

**Format**: `"[User/persona] needs a way to [need] because [insight]."`

### How Might We (HMW) Questions

Transform problems into opportunities:

- Start with "How might we..."
- Frame positively (opportunities, not limitations)
- Be broad enough to explore multiple solutions
- Be specific enough to be actionable
- Focus on user needs

**Example**: "How might we help busy parents track their children's activities without adding to their cognitive load?"

### Working Approach

- **Synthesize, Don't Summarize**: Look for patterns and meanings
- **Frame Positively**: Turn challenges into opportunities
- **Stay User-Centered**: Keep focus on user needs
- **Be Specific**: Avoid vague or generic statements
- **Validate**: Test problem statements with users/stakeholders

### Prohibited Actions

- ❌ Do not propose specific solutions yet
- ❌ Do not ignore research findings in favor of assumptions
- ❌ Do not create problem statements that embed solutions
- ❌ Do not define success only in business metrics
- ❌ Do not skip stakeholder validation

## Success Criteria

The Define phase is complete when:

- ✅ Problem statements are clear and validated
- ✅ Team has shared understanding of the problem
- ✅ HMW questions inspire multiple solution approaches
- ✅ Success metrics are defined and measurable
- ✅ Priorities are clear and agreed upon
- ✅ Stakeholders are aligned on problem definition
- ✅ Design principles guide solution development

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Solution Embedding**: Writing problem statements that assume a solution
2. **Too Broad**: Defining problems so broadly they're not actionable
3. **Too Narrow**: Limiting the solution space too much
4. **Tech-Centered**: Framing from technology perspective vs. user needs
5. **Ignoring Research**: Defining problems based on assumptions
6. **Metric Obsession**: Focusing only on measurable at expense of meaningful

## Example Artifacts

### Problem Statement Example

**Poor**: "We need a mobile app for scheduling."
**Good**: "Working parents need a way to coordinate family schedules across multiple calendars because they struggle to keep track of everyone's commitments and often experience conflicts or missed events."

### HMW Question Examples

- How might we help users quickly understand their family's schedule at a glance?
- How might we reduce the mental burden of coordinating multiple calendars?
- How might we prevent scheduling conflicts before they happen?
- How might we make it easy to share schedule updates with all family members?

### Design Principles Example

1. **Clarity Over Features**: Prioritize clear information over adding features
2. **Respect User Time**: Every interaction should be quick and purposeful
3. **Family-Focused**: Design for collaboration, not individual use
4. **Proactive, Not Reactive**: Prevent problems before they occur

## Transition to Design Phase

You're ready to move to the Design phase when:

- Problem statements are validated and agreed upon
- Success metrics are clearly defined
- HMW questions provide clear direction
- Stakeholders are aligned
- Priorities are established
- Design principles are set
- Team is ready to ideate solutions

## Tools & Templates

### Synthesis Tools

- Affinity mapping
- Insight cards
- Pattern identification frameworks
- Synthesis canvas

### Problem Framing Tools

- Problem statement template
- HMW question generator
- Design principles framework
- Success metrics canvas

### Prioritization Tools

- Impact/effort matrix
- Value vs. complexity grid
- MoSCoW prioritization
- Stakeholder voting

## Tips for Effective Problem Statements

1. **Start with User**: Begin with who you're solving for
2. **Articulate Need**: Be specific about the need or challenge
3. **Provide Context**: Explain why this matters
4. **Avoid Solutions**: Don't say "needs an app" or "needs a feature"
5. **Make it Inspiring**: Frame to inspire creative solutions

## Validation Checklist

Review your problem statements:

- [ ] Is it based on research evidence?
- [ ] Does it focus on user needs, not solutions?
- [ ] Is it specific enough to be actionable?
- [ ] Is it broad enough to allow creative solutions?
- [ ] Does it inspire the team?
- [ ] Have users/stakeholders validated it?
- [ ] Does it align with business objectives?

**Remember**: A well-defined problem is halfway to a solution. Take time to get the problem framing right before jumping into design.
