# Agent.MD Knowledge-Base

This repository contains a collection of Agent.MD files designed to bootstrap AI agents for projects following the Human-Centered Design (HCD) with Agile methodology.

**New to Agent.MD files?** Start with the [Getting Started Guide](Getting-Started) for a quick introduction.

## What is an Agent.MD File?

An Agent.MD file is a structured markdown document that provides context, guidelines, and instructions to AI agents working on a project. It serves as a "bootstrap" file that helps AI understand:

- Project goals and objectives
- Methodological approach (HCDAgile in this case)
- Phase-specific requirements and constraints
- Best practices and conventions
- Team context and stakeholder information

## HCDAgile Methodology Overview

HCDAgile combines Human-Centered Design principles with Agile development practices:

### Core Principles

1. **Empathy First**: Understand user needs deeply before building
2. **Iterative Development**: Build, test, and refine in short cycles
3. **Cross-functional Collaboration**: Bring together diverse perspectives
4. **Continuous User Feedback**: Validate assumptions with real users
5. **Incremental Value Delivery**: Ship working solutions frequently

### Phases

The HCDAgile methodology follows five key phases:

1. **Discovery**: Research and understand the problem space
2. **Define**: Synthesize insights and define problem statements
3. **Design**: Ideate and prototype solutions
4. **Develop**: Build and test the solution iteratively
5. **Deliver**: Launch, monitor, and iterate based on feedback

## Quick Start

1. **New to Agent.MD?** Read the [Getting Started Guide](./Getting-Started)
2. **Review the phase-specific Agent.MD files** in [`agents/phases/`](./agents/phases
3. **Use the template** in [`agents/templates/`](./agents/templateso create custom Agent.MD files
4. **See examples** in `agents/examples/` for inspiration
5. **Customize files** for your specific project needs

## Contributing

To add new Agent.MD files to this knowledge-base:

1. Use the template structure
2. Ensure alignment with [HCDAgile principles](../docs/HCD-Agile-Overview)
3. Add clear, actionable guidance
4. Update the [index.md](./ catalog
