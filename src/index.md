# HCD Agile AI

Using an AI agent to follow Human-Centered Design with an Agile approach

This repository provides a meta-framework for implementing Human-Centered Design (HCD) with an Agile approach in collaboration with AI agents. The framework emphasizes shared vision, cross-functional collaboration (human-AI), and continuous validation.

## About HCD Agile

[HCD Agile](docs/HCD-Agile-Overview) is a methodology that combines Human-Centered Design (HCD) principles with Agile development practices. This approach ensures that software products are built efficiently and iteratively while meeting the real needs of users through continuous research, testing, and validation.

### Key Principles

- **Empathy First**: Understand users deeply through research and observation
- **Iterative Learning**: Each sprint includes learning cycles about user needs
- **Continuous Validation**: Test with real users frequently
- **Collaborative Design**: Cross-functional teams work together throughout
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Define success through user-centric metrics

### What is it?

HCDAgile combines the empathy and user focus of Human-Centered Design with the iterative, collaborative approach of Agile development. This methodology ensures that teams:

- Build solutions users actually need and want
- Iterate quickly based on real feedback  
- Deliver value incrementally
- Maintain quality and sustainability
- Keep users at the center of all decisions
